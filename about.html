				<h2> Who we are </h2>
				<p> We are a group of university students brought together to build a mobile application with a topic of our choice. We quickly decided to make drinKit as it was a shared interest between us all.  </p>

				<h2> What we built </h2>
				<p> drinKit is a drink making tutorial application offering an option to those who don’t just want alcoholic content. Our clear step by step instructions mean even the least experienced of users can easily make tasty drinks while learning some basic skills.  </p>

				<h2> Why we built </h2>
				<p> During early market research we realised that most applications on this subject currently out there tended to have a focus on alcohol only. Many also didn’t specify which recipes were unsuitable for those with certain dietary requirements. As members of our team have such requirements, from this moment on, we really wanted to make an application that offered a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks that were suitable for all.  </p>
